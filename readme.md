#Flight Calculator

Tool for finding the cheapest destinations for you and a friend to travel to together, when coming from different places. Meant to be fun for finding the cheapest place to meet long distance friends.

####Instructions
1. Enter the origin airports that you and your friend are flying out of.
2. Enter the date when you're interested in traveling.
3. Run the app and get back a list of the combined price for a bunch of US airports that you both could fly to.

####Notes
Currently the app is using a free API from Travelpayouts [Travelpayouts Data API](https://support.travelpayouts.com/hc/en-us/articles/203956163-Travel-insights-with-Travelpayouts-Data-API) that uses only cached flight search info. Lots of data returned is currently "missing" as a result of this. The project may eventually migrate to their "real-time" [Flights Search API](https://support.travelpayouts.com/hc/en-us/articles/203956173-Flights-search-API-Real-time-and-multi-city-search) which will presumably provide more reliable data results.
